Tur-Archiver 2.x is a total rewrite from 1.x. It can copy, move   
or make symlinks from whatever you want, to wherever you want.    
                                                                   
It is NOT a spacemaker and shouldnt be used as such.              
                                                               
It's more meant as a "sorter" of some kind. You specify WHERE it    
should look, WHAT it should look for and WHERE you want to put it.
By putting it, I mean either copy, move or make a symlink to it.
