rud-filedone

This is a small c program that writes things to the gllog that two of my
scripts use.

There are two different ways of configuring it, either as post_check script
in your glftpd.conf file or as sample_script in your zconfig.h in pzs-ng.
If you use it as sample script it will only execute when sample files are
encountered which of course disables the rar support.

If you configure it as post_check script you might need to edit the defines
at the top of the c file if you have an exotic environment.

With the script two tcl scripts for the eggdrop are included. One for
handling mkv files and one for mp4 files. Just copy them and their theme
files to your plugin directory in pzs-ng and source them in your eggdrop
config after pzs-ng. There are three configuration settings. Where to find
your passwd file, what irc trigger to use and what channel to output to.


INSTALL:

A) post_check

edit defines in rud-filedone.c if needed

make

copy rud-filedone to your glftpd bin dir

edit glftpd.conf and replace your post_check script with this one like below

post_check      /bin/rud-filedone *
#post_check      /bin/zipscript-c *


B) sample_script

edit defines in rud-filedone.c if needed

make samplescript

copy rud-filedone to your glftpd bin dir

edit zsconfig.h and set:

#define enable_sample_script            TRUE
#define sample_script                   "/bin/sample_script.sh"

add a sample_script.sh in your glftpd bin and add the following to it and
chmod it +x:

#!/bin/bash
/bin/rud-filedone $1 $PWD omgponies
exit 0

recompile and reinstall your pzs-ng
